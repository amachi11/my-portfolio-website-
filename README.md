Purpose

Built to demonstrate frontend development skills, UI design, and JavaScript interactivity in a real-world portfolio project.


Build Process (Step-by-Step)

Planned the layout

Chose a single-page structure with sections: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact.

Built the HTML structure

Created semantic sections and containers.

Added navigation links that scroll to each section using IDs (e.g., #about, #projects).

Styled the site with CSS

Set up CSS variables for theme colors.

Designed reusable components (buttons, cards, tags/chips).

Built responsive layouts using grid/flexbox.

Added media queries for mobile (navbar becomes hamburger menu).

Added JavaScript interactivity

Coded the hamburger button to toggle the mobile nav menu.

Auto-closed the menu when a nav link is clicked.

Set the footer year automatically with new Date().getFullYear().

Built the contact form behavior

Added form validation using HTML required.

Prevented page reload on submit and displayed a “Saved!” message (frontend demo).

Left it backend-ready to connect later with Flask.

Prepared project images + placeholders

Added project cards with thumbnails and fallback image handling.

Final testing

Checked mobile + desktop responsiveness.

Click-tested nav links, buttons, and form behavior.

Cleaned up text and spacing for a polished portfolio look.
